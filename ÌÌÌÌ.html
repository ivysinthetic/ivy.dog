            <h2>so i'm like 15 years late on this whole thing but like...</h2>

            <p>it's become pretty clear to me at this point that big tech is a fucking nightmare dystopia and AI is going to ruin literally everything</p>
            <p>i dont really want to write out a whole rant, you either already agree with this or you don't, and you either think its worth consideration or you've just accepted it's inevitability</p>
            <p>while i have in large part accepted what is to come as Going To Happen, i at least want to limit my exposure to it as much as i possibly can</p>
            <p>this is a long winded way of me trying to say that i think im going to finally switch to linux, probably Debian sometime next year lmfao</p>
            <p>i've already migrated a lot of what i can off of gmail, although i will admit their file hosting & well, you know, YouTube are pretty useful so its not like i can just go scorched earth</p>
            <p>i don't have much to say or wax poetically about rn, just that i tried to google something the other day and literally could not find the answer to my question from a reliable source and that is only going to be a more common experience as time goes on.</p>
            <p>RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</p>
            <p>oh also, merry christmas! that's why i didnt just make this a tweet because its a bit too depressing lol. maybe ill tweet about it sometime its weird to plan out tweets like that though so maybe i wont unless the spirit really strikes me like it has now. HAPPY FREAKING HOLIDAYS SEE YOU IN 2024 BYEBYE!</p>
