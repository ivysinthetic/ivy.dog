            <h2>of transness as it pertains to passing</h2>

            <span class="cw">cw: trans angst</span>

            <p>so nothing im about to say here is particularly revolutionary </p>

            <p>i hate so much the dichotemy that 'passing' presents. it is a nightmare mind virus that i wish i never caught</p>

            <p>the idea of passing itself implicitly engineers your everyday experience along the lines of either passing, or failing. as young trans women we are shown that this goal is attainable by being presented with those who have <i>made it.</i> there are people out there who pass, and so it naturally follows suit that many of us form this shared goal of one day passing.</p>

            <p>early on this can honestly be nice, after many years likely feeling alone and ostrasized from the rest of the Normal World, you wake up one morning to find yourself with people who are just like you and who share this common goal. failures early on are easy to brush off, after all, you've only just started taking HRT, of course you're not going to Pass right away, besides all of this is new and fun and the little changes you have noticed are all exciting (omg is my skin already getting softer >w<)</p>

            <p>but as the days turn in to months turn in to years, the excitement and novelty and Potential has all morphed and twisted itself into a creeping dread. you've been on hormones for years, you've voice trained and told everyone your new pronouns, you've been going by your new name for so long that you barely remember ever going by any other name... and yet you still don't pass.</p>

            <p>and then you find yourself thinking horrible self defeating things along the lines of how awful your transition is going and comparing yourself to other trans women and ultimately just being extremely cruel to yourself.</p>
