            <h1>ABOUT!</h1>

            <p>about pages are hard... but i like reading them on other people's personal sites so i thought id write one</p>
            <p>that said the main reason i think theyre hard to write is whenever i imagine someone who knows me reading them i get really embarassed, so if you must make fun of my cringe about page, PLEASE do it behind my back, OKAY!!! thank u :)</p>

            <h2>whomst</h2>

            <p>i'm ivy! i live in the wonderful city of Seattle and make music, and i guess also doing gamedev as a hobby but its been a minute since i've been down that rabbit hole.. lately i've just been scheming and dealing, and making a few friends along the way... >:)</p>

            <h2>what gear do u use broe</h2>
            <p>i made <a href="/gear.html">a page for that</a> and couldn't think of a more elegant way to link to it</p>
