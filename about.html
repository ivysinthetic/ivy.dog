            <h1>ABOUT!</h1>

            <p>about pages are hard... but i like reading them on other people's personal sites so i thought id write one</p>
            <p>but theyre mostly hard in that whenever i imagine someone who knows me reading them i get really embarassed, so if you must make fun of my cringe about page, PLEASE do it behind my back, OKAY!!! thank u :)</p>

            <h2>whomst</h2>

            <p>i dont know myself very well and i have a very short attention span, but i really love making art, especially music.</p>

            <p>i live in the pnw and i love it here and i hate my job because it saps me of all energy always, but i prefer that to being scared about money :(</p>

            <p>i don't think i'll ever be happy until i'm making my Living from art, as much as that sucks to admit</p>
