            <p>
                hiya! this is the first in a series (if i remember to keep up with this lmao) of lil' blogs! 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                i intend on writing any number of miscellaneous things in here, from random short little thoughts, funny things that happen, things i think are cool, or just when i feel like writing something :>  
            </p>
            <p>
                the format of these is going to be pretty lose and silly most of the time, things might get serious occasionally though, so who knows! i suppose the first thing I could write out in here is a lil' bit more in depth of an about me so, uh-
            </p>
            
            <h2>ABOUT ME! (lil' 自己紹介 moment)</h2>
            
            <p>
                so if you're reading this, you probably already know this but like, i need to write something on my website or what good is it! my name is ivy! i'm 27 years old and I was born in south florida, but now reside in washington, just a few miles outside of seattle. in march of 2021, i realized i was trans and on april 1st (happy trans visibility day), i started HRT!~ this was the best desicion that i have ever made.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                i have a pretty wide range of interests, thanks mostly to my just absolutely out of control ADHD. my primary focus is music, but i also enjoy playing rhythm games (IIDX/BMS, WACCA, and DDR/ITG being my faves), DJing, creating worlds for VRChat, and every once in a blue moon I might work on gamedev of some sort in unity.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What have I been up to recently?</h2>
            
            <p>
                well, i recently bought the domain <a href="/">[ivy.dog]</a>, so i then (with the assitance of vyvanse) felt compelled to finally, actually, make myself a personal website, which is something that i've wanted to do for a looong time :3 other than that i've spent a lot of time recently listening to music outside of the kind of stuff i tend to gravitate towards usually, right now i'm listening to <a href="https://holdinghandsrecords.bandcamp.com/track/hood-mentality">[KESSLER - HOOD MENTALITY]</a>, which is a tune that just came up on spotify while i was working on this site, its pretty comfy, right?!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                okay, my brain is no longer working and i can't think of literally anything else to say at this point, so uhhhh BYEBYE for now!
