                2022 has been a major transitionary year for me. 
            </p>

            <h2>exiting my posting era</h2>

            <p>
                so it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone to hear me say this, but i don't think i like twitter very much. i know i'm breaking some pretty new ground right now by being brave enough to say this, so let me explain a bit how i came to this conclusion.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>okay, so truthfully nothing i'm about to say is exclusive to twitter, twitter just happens to be the site that i used most often. what i'm saying here could apply to any social media site with an alogrithm and metrics.</i> so with that disclaimer out of the way:
            </p>

            <p>
                i have held this idea for a while that, to be a Successful Artist in the Online Era, you have to Post. if the numbers aren't going up, you aren't becoming more successful. obviously, the way sites with alogrithms like twitter's are designed intentionally instills this idea into you, but there's also a healthy dose of survivorship-bias at play here as well. it's so easy to look at an artist-you-like-who-is-very-online's page and see their follower count and see their Metrics and think to yourself, "if only i had a following like that, if only i had <i>numbers</i> like that, <i>then</i> i would feel successful." i think this is something that a lot of, if not all, online creators struggle with. some folks are definitely better at dealing with this feeling than others, and for some people this model really does work as another source of motivation.
            </p>

            <p>
                for me personally, though, what this did to me is it made me constantly have this urge to post. this thought pervaded me: "if i'm not posting something often, people will forget about me, people will leave me, i won't be able to Grow my Audience if that happens." this idea crumbles under pretty much any scrutiny, but twitter is addictive like that. yes you know you don't need to do this, but you <i>might</i> see a bigger number than you did last time. that one cool artist who follows you might interact with it and give you that dopamine rush. twitter being the social platform that it is, these thoughts don't just poison one's own concept of their artistic value, but can make you feel like you're performing friendship in a way that feels really gross to me. it's like microdosing relationships, it's just enough that you feel like you're kind of connecting with somebody, but it's all so performative that it feels meaningless a lot of the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                it's not all bad, of course. if it wasn't for twitter, i wouldn't have made many friends that i now consider dear to me. when i was in a financial hole, so many folks who i've never met, and may never properly get the chance to meet, helped me, literally kept me fed and housed for a couple months. it is inconceivable that people are willing to help out someone like me, but i will never forget that kindness, and i will continue paying that kindness forward for as long as i possibly can. a large part of the reason i'm not just deactivating my twitter account like my impulses tell me to do is because of this. 
            </p>

            <p>
                all that said though, twitter has been directly responsible for a lot of the worst parts of 2022 for me. i don't want to harp on about this since it's well treaded ground, but twitter feeds on outrage and anger and pettyness to a terrifying degree. everything from tiny little quips and quote-retweets, to large scale call-outs is, and always will be, such an absurdly effective way to get attention — to get that social media dopamine hit — it poisons every thought and action. it rewards good-guy bad-guy dichotomies and leaves no room for any gray area; there's Us, and there's Them. if you're not with us, if you're not willing to Use Your Platform to Push Out Bad Actors, then you're clearly at least a little bit on Their side. it's maddening. it's friendship ruining. i hate it so much. it's such a pervasive cognito-hazard that it colors the way discussions happen in real life, too. i simply do not have it in me to even see this stuff anymore, let alone take part in it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                so between That, and the drive twitter creates to stay posting always, i've decided that i need to spend way, <i>way</i> less time on there. i'm not deleting my account for a lot of reasons, some of which i touched on earlier. im merely transitioning it from less of a personal space and diary to more of a, "hey i made this thing check it out!" type zone. frankly, i also just want to be more private in general. i don't think putting myself as Out There as i have been for the last year has been good for my brain. it sounds pretentious as fuck what i am about to say, but i'd rather express myself through the things i make. it's more honest like that, anyways. 
            </p>

            <p>
                i'm not Going Offline, either. my personal twitter account isn't going anywhere, and if you know me you probably already have my discord or telegram and i'm as online there as i ever have been. i also still use tumblr and all that jazz from time to time, i just removed the links from my site since its not necessarily somewhere that i want as front and center as everything else anymore.
            </p>

            <h2>2023 plans</h2>

            <p>
                i don't want to speak too much about my plans for next year, since i like surprises, but also because if i say i'm gonna do something and then don't do it i'll feel silly. in short, though, i want to do more of the things i've always wanted to do and get better at all the things i love.
            </p>

            <p>
                that's all i really have to say for right now! if you read all of that, or skimmed it, or just skipped to this paragraph for some reason, uh, thank you so much. the fact that anyone cares about what i'm doing constantly blows my mind and i'll never be able to express my gratitude enough. see u next year :3
