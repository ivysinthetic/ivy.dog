            <h2>hi!</h2>            
            
            <p>
                2022 has been a major transitionary year for me. i have changed and grown so much in the last twelve months that it is hard to even get straight in my own head all of the things that have happened. i have made new friends that i treasure, had so many lovely moments, and learned a lot about myself and who i want to be. the person i was this time last year was so lost and scared and didn't even realize it. i certainly don't feel like i've completely figured myself out, but for the first time i feel certain that i've started making progress. 
            </p>

            <h2>spring cleaning (winter edition)</h2>

            <p>
                you may have noticed i've cleaned up my twitter account and deleted a bunch of stuff from there. i've been slowly moving away from using twitter (at least my main public account) as a place to be social for the last few months. there's a lot of reasons that i have for wanting to do this (that i don't really want to get into), but it essentially boils down to improving my mental health and wanting more privacy. things may change in the future, i mean it's hard to even tell if twitter will even exist next week the way things are going, but for now this is something i want to do for my own sake! :3
            </p>

            <p>
                i've also tidied up this site a bunch, dusted out the corners, deleted some stuff, added some more stuff. a real webmaster over here, i am. i'm really glad i made this site, and i plan on continuining to use it for a bit more things next year :3 everyone should make a personal site, yes even <b>you</b>!
            </p>

            <h2>next year!</h2>

            <p>
                i don't want to speak <i>too</i> much about my plans for next year, mostly because i like surprises, but also because if i say i'm gonna do something and then don't do it i'll feel silly. in short, though, i want to do more of the things i've always wanted to do and get better at all the things i love. writing that out i realize its vague as hell but! idk! you'll hopefully find out soon enough :3
            </p>

            <p>
                personally, i'd like to spend my time i'm not going to be on twitter playing games i've been meaning to play for years and finally getting around to reading freaking books. also watching more movies, although i was gonna do that regardless. god i love movies (and films, too) so much.
            </p>

            <p>
                that's all i really have to say for right now! if you read all of that, or skimmed it, or just skipped to this paragraph for some reason, uh, thank you so much. the fact that anyone cares about what i'm doing constantly blows my mind and i'll never be able to express my gratitude enough. 
            </p>

            <p>
                see y'all next year :3
            </p>
