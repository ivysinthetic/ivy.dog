            <p>
                for most of my adult life, i have been pretty much entirely sedentary and not taken very good care of my body, and i have reached a point in my life where i actually care for once haha

                really the only thing i've been doing is walking and playing more dance games when i go to the arcade. i don't feel like i need to espouse the benefits of walking as if you don't already know that Going For A Nice Walk Outside is Really Good Cool And Nice — that being said, you absolutely by any means necessary should start going for walks outside!  
            </p>

                it's like, theres the obvious physical benefits of walking, but also theres the mental health benefits of just being alone with your thoughts. its really annoying that the stereotypical neurotypical's response to someone being anxious is "just go for a walk you'll feel better" because ITS LITERALLY TRUE!!! you wont magically be cured but it is nice to just move around and look at stuff when your mind is swarming, ya know!

                other than walking i've also been playing a lot of DDR (well, a lot more than usual haha). my local arcade has online DDR cabs with pretty decent pads and its been super fun to finally for the first time in my life try and get good at the game.

                i'm still super baby at it, i only just now started being able to clear 13s but! its not only just fun to play even though i suck, its also just like a really nice cardio excersize haha — i seriously recommend to everyone to pick this game up if you have it available to you!
