            <h2>so i'm sick of working in food service (imagine that)</h2>
            
            <p>
                i've basically worked in either food service or retail since i have been an adult and i'd like to do uh literally anything else lmao. 
            </p>

            <p>
                have been spinning my wheels thinking i wanted to do some sort of programming job, but after a lot of consideration (read: years of procrastination and lack of executive function), i don't think that's a zone i am comfortable with just jumping straight into ;u; 
            </p>

            <p>
                so instead i'm taking steps in A Direction (pretty big fuckin' news all things considered) and actually trying to head down the path of getting CompTIA A+ certified and landing a HelpDesk job, and eventually getting Network+ and Security+ and maybe CCNA as well??? and trying to sneak in to the networking or cybersecurity zone???

            <p>
                i've been starting to study, and a lot of the A+ is remedial stuff, but most of the networking stuff is not something i've ever formally studied, so i'm kinda putting a lot of concrete definitions on things that i've only understood abstractly for my whole life ahahaha
            </p>

            <p>
                it's been fun studying this stuff, i'm innately interested in networking so it's really easy to be hungry to keep on learning more about it. but what's even nicer is finally having literally any direction in my life ^~^

                feels really good.
