- DAW: *FL Studio* forever bby, occasionally *logic pro* and *audacity*
- *OTT* and the free *Kilohearts* plugins are like 99% of the fx i use besides like, basic dynamics / filtering for which i just use the FL built in stuff â€“ shouts out *Parametric EQ2* & *Fruity Limiter*
- *MAIM* is sick and free check it out, mp3 compression + other indescribable audio distortion
- on that note also, *Codec* by lese
- *Stephen Slate Drums* free version is SO fucking good even tho it annoyingly requires an account to download
- *ezdrummer3 alt-rock* is my "real" drums vst of choice these days, though
- i use the shit out of *serum*, *autotune*, and *manipulator*, as well as an old version of *Ozone* i got on sale like 4 years ago
