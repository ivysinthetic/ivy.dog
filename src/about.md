## FAQs

  - yes, i technically release under a CC-BY-SA license which you can read about if you're curious, but the jist is that you can do anything you want with my stuff, copyright is bs and anti-art and the only reason i don't just public domain everything is to have any leverage against web 3.0 type dudes should my work ever be used to try and promote something of theirs lmao
