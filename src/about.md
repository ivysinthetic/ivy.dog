about pages are hard... but i like reading them on other people's personal sites so i thought id write one

that said the main reason i think theyre hard to write is whenever i imagine someone who knows me reading them i get really embarassed, so if you must make fun of my cringe about page, PLEASE do it behind my back, OKAY!!! thank u :)

## whomst

i'm ivy! i live in the wonderful city of Seattle and make music, and i guess also doing gamedev as a hobby but its been a minute since i've been down that rabbit hole.. lately i've just been scheming and dealing, and making a few friends along the way... >:)

## gear?
