## 10.2.2024

the website has gotten a facelift. there's really only two reasons for this:

1. i was getting bored of the old design
2. i wanted to make it easier to blog on

for the first point, that i could have done pretty simply without changing anything else... BUT that leads into the second point which is way harder to notice: 

*i've gone from handwriting all my pages in html directly in the text editor to using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) instead!*

11ty is a static site generator which allows me to write my webpages in markdown instead, and then it handles converting that all into html for me!

this allows me to maintain my core pillars of what i want this website to be (brutalist, no client side javascript running ever, lightweight), while simulteneously making it much simpler to add / make changes to the site itself

it's been a bit of a learning curve to set it up, i've never used npm or node.js, but following the official documentation was really easy and i think if you've been considering switching to a static site generator its a pretty easy recommendation

thanks to this new ease of adding little things to the site, i want to update it more frequently. we'll see if i actually follow through with that but for now, that's my goal! ultimately, this is all part of my increased desire to limit the time i spend on any infinite feed websites and wanting to move towards smaller pockets of the web. i'm sure you've read that on about 1000 personal sites but whatever broe

i'll probably write a blogpost about that in the future, so stay tuned. subscribe to my rss feed! fuck i need to set up an rss feed.
