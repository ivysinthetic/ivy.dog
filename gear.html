            <ul>i do not own an amp ;o;</ul>

            <h2>the extent of it all</h2>
            <p>tbh lately i've been really heavily considering downsizing and simplifying my entire approach to making music. i am so, so familiar with the tools that i use which, on one hand, makes the process have almost no friction between idea & execution, which owns. but on the other hand, i so often feel like i'm just going through the motions and the process does not lend it self to sponteneity which kinda has worn on me over time. that, coupled with the endless perfectionism that comes with working & being comfortable in a DAW with instant access to EQs and Compressors and Noise Gates and pitch correction and all of that has me spending a lot of time working on music and very little time just chilling and having fun and like, finishing literally anything lmfao</p>

            <p>my next big musical purchase is gonna be a multitrack portastudio and even if i will almost certainly not ever abandon my current set up, i definitely wanna venture a bit out of my comfort zone so.... watch this space, i guess! if anyone reading this wants to talk to me about portastudios, please hit my line lmao</p>
