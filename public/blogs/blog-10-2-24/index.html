        <h2>10.2.2024</h2>
<p>the website has gotten a facelift. there's really only two reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>i was getting bored of the old design</li>
<li>i wanted to make it easier to blog on</li>
</ol>
<p>for the first point, that i could have done pretty simply without changing anything else... BUT that leads into the second point which is way harder to notice:</p>
<p><em>i've gone from handwriting all my pages in html directly in the text editor to using <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> instead!</em></p>
<p>11ty is a static site generator which allows me to write my webpages in markdown instead, and then it handles converting that all into html for me!</p>
<p>this allows me to maintain my core pillars of what i want this website to be (brutalist, no client side javascript running ever, lightweight), while simulteneously making it much simpler to add / make changes to the site itself</p>
<p>it's been a bit of a learning curve to set it up, i've never used npm or node.js, but following the official documentation was really easy and i think if you've been considering switching to a static site generator its a pretty easy recommendation</p>
<p>thanks to this new ease of adding little things to the site, i want to update it more frequently. we'll see if i actually follow through with that but for now, that's my goal! ultimately, this is all part of my increased desire to limit the time i spend on any infinite feed websites and wanting to move towards smaller pockets of the web. i'm sure you've read that on about 1000 personal sites but whatever broe</p>
<p>i'll probably write a blogpost about that in the future, so stay tuned. subscribe to my rss feed! fuck i need to set up an rss feed.</p>
