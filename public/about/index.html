        <h2>About:</h2>

        <h3>Me (Ivy)</h3>
        
        <p>The gist is that I'm a woman who lives in Washington, USA. Sometimes, I make things and then release them on the web.</p>

        <p>I'd like to get better at drawing, and writing (especially fiction).</p>

        <h3>ivy sinthetic (me)</h3>

        <p>My main hobby and passion is writing music, and I release about 0.1% of the music I make online on places like <a href="https://ivysinthetic.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ivysinthetic/">Soundcloud</a>. Sometimes, I'll go through the trouble of releasing it on streaming services as well since that is where the majority of people are. Even some-r times I post vlogs or short silly videos on <a href="https://youtube.com/@ibbyvids">YouTube</a>!</p>

        <p>If you're interested, I've listed out the gear I use on <a href="../gear">it's own page</a> :D</p>

        <h3>This Site</h3>

        <p>Despite what every member of the W3C would like you to believe, you <em>(yes, you!)</em> can just make your own website, and point a domain to someone that's hosting it (or host it yourself), and then anyone else can look at it. It's actually like completely amazing to me, even still after how much corporate interest has twisted it into something primarly used to make you <em>(yes, you!)</em> want to kill yourself, but that's neither here nor there!</p>

        <p>This site is constructed solely of HTML and CSS written in either <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> or <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> (depending on which computer I'm on when I feel like editing this site...)</p>
            
        <p>I didn't have any experience with either of those languages outside of customizing my neopets pet-pages and myspace layout as a kid about 10,000 years ago, and learned it by just web searching whenever I wanted to do something. For a while, I was using <a href="11ty.dev">eleventy</a> as a static site generator, but managing the js dependencies across multiple machines was too freaking annoying despite how nice it was to just write each page in markdown, so umm ano eto bleh, I'm back just hand writing HTML again.</p>

        <p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://nixihost.com/">NixiHost</a>, which uses <a href="https://www.cpanel.net/">cPanel</a> as its hosting platform. It was an absolutely massive learning curve compared to <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, which I was using before, but I am happy I went through the process of learning it :D. That said, if you're interested in making your own personal site, I would reccomend Neocities (as you've no doubt heard of), or maybe something like <a href="https://nekoweb.org/">NekoWeb</a> (which has a bit less restrictions on free accounts compared to Neocities). There's literally endless options and it's easy to learn and it's fun...</p>

        <h3>Social Media</h3>

        <p>As I've <a href="../blogs/blog-24-11-06">written before</a> and generally drone endlessly on about, I am growing more disinterested with participating in social media with each passing year. I've been fighting the urge to go scorched-earth for a while, but just not-looking-at-it has been enough to keep me from going insane. I might still do it in the future who knows!</p>

        <p>So, in the meantime, you can follow me at the following locations if you'd like, but please be aware that I rarely look at and even rarelier post on them.</p>

        <h3>You</h3>

        <p>Thank you <em>(yes, you!)</em> for reading this (or even just scrolling past it all thinking something like "damn this binch likes to yap okay"). If you liked reading all this BS you might like reading my blogs but no pressure I'm even more annoying when I write them. Umm... ano eto bleh have a good day bye-bye. </p>
