        <h1>about me!</h1>
        <p>about pages are hard... but i like reading them on other people's personal sites so i thought id write one</p>
<p>that said the main reason i think theyre hard to write is whenever i imagine someone who knows me reading them i get really embarassed, so if you must make fun of my cringe about page, PLEASE do it behind my back, OKAY!!! thank u :)</p>
<h2>whomst</h2>
<p>i'm ivy! i live in the wonderful city of Seattle and make music, and i guess also doing gamedev as a hobby but its been a minute since i've been down that rabbit hole.. lately i've just been scheming and dealing, and making a few friends along the way... &gt;:)</p>
<h2>gear?</h2>
